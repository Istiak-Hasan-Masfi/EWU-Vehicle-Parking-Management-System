# EWU-Vehicle-Parking-Management-System

The EWU Vehicle Parking Management System is a database-driven web application designed to manage vehicle parking inside the East West University (EWU) campus in an organized and efficient way. This project replaces the traditional manual parking system with a digital solution that records vehicle information, manages parking slots, and tracks parking activities in real time.

The system supports multiple user roles including Admin, Student, Faculty, Staff, and Security, each with specific permissions. Users can register vehicles, view available and occupied parking slots, and manage parking sessions. Security staff can monitor vehicle entry and exit, while admins can manage users, slots, vehicles, payments, and generate reports.

This project simulates a real-life university parking scenario and focuses on reducing parking congestion, improving security, and ensuring proper utilization of parking spaces through a well-structured relational database.
